Always check the index.html file to see what tuts and systems we have currently instead of checking all the files.

Assume a beginner and explain in an intuitive way.

Topics explained should be divided into separate files of beginner, intermediate, expert and advanced so that they can be edited individually so that the length limits are not hit. Create a separate index file linking these files and content. The index file should always be consistent with the content added or edited.

Show diagrams where required.

Focus on teaching in an applicative way, giving examples.

Indexes should be used in the beginning for any long informative topics and they should be clickable.

See if the code sections can be made collapsible.

Make sure the code examples are error and bug free. Always check the console for any errors.

Try and make changes in an iterative way(refer the index file).  Before making any major changes like removing an existing section, ask.
