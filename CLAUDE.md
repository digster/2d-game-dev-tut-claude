Assume a beginner and explain in an intuitive way.

Topics explained should be divided into separate files of beginner, intermediate, expert and advanced so that they can be edited individually so that the length limits are not hit. Create a separate index file linking these files and content.

Show diagrams where required.

Focus on teaching in an applicative way, giving examples.

Indexes should be used in the beginning for any long informative topics and they should be clickable.

See if the code sections can be made collapsible.

Check the code examples for any bugs.

Try and make changes in an iterative way. Before making any major changes like removing an existing section, ask.
